Not enough sleep, however, means that we lack the opportunity to restore ourselves physiologically, emotionally and cognitively. It affects our mood and can result in behaviour and performance problems. When we sleep, our bodies rest but our brains are active. Sleep lays the groundwork for a productive day ahead. Although most people benefit the most from eight hours of sleep each night, this is not always what they manage to achieve. Men get slightly less sleep than women during the week (6.7 hours/night vs. 7.0 hours /night), but have fewer sleep problems, according to recent Sleep in America polls conducted annually by the National Sleep Foundation (NSF).</p><p class='paraalign' ><b>B.</b>&nbsp;According to current scientific thought, the human body is pre-programmed for sleep. At nightfall, cells in the retina (a light sensitive membrane connected to the eye by the optic nerve) send a sleep signal to a cluster of nerve cells in the brain. These nerve cells are concentrated together in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and are located in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus which helps regulate body temperature. The SCN is also known as the circadian clock. This biological 'clock' relays the message to other parts of the brain which then signals the body that it is time to sleep. For instance, the pineal gland, also located in the hypothalamus, produces a substance called melatonin, which lowers body temperature, and causes drowsiness.</p><p class='paraalign'><b>C.</b>&nbsp;A great deal of the information we now know about sleep and the physiological changes it causes in the brain can be traced back to the invention of the electroencephalogram in the 1950s. This machine allowed scientists to record the feeble electric currents generated on the brain without opening the skull and to depict them graphically onto a strip of paper. Brain-wave function could be examined and scientists could thereby observe sleep from moment to moment. In the 1970s it became possible for scientists to make assumptions about the role that correct breathing plays during sleep with the development of the technology to measure respiration. It was here that science really began to understand the nature of sleep and the role it plays in people's lives.</p><p class='paraalign'><b>D.</b>&nbsp;As well as uncovering the physiological changes occurring during sleep, The New England Journal of Medicine reported that sleep concerns were a public health threat as serious as smoking and in the years since, medical researchers have linked sleep disorders with many life-threatening diseases. Even though more than 70 million Americans have a sleeping problem, most cases go undiagnosed and untreated, so the true economic and sociological damage caused by these disorders is unknown although, the economic cost is conservatively estimated to be billions of dollars a year in healthcare costs and lost productivity. Breathing problems during sleep represent by far the greatest proportion of sleep disorders and cause the most concern, with studies showing that between 50% and 80% of stroke and heart failure patients have breathing problems during sleep.</p><p class='paraalign'><b>E.</b>&nbsp;Scientific studies have found that children who are identified as snorers or those who have poor sleeping patterns at around the age of four or five, scored lower than average in Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests, not only during the sleep deprivation period but subsequent to that. There are also suggestions that ongoing sleep deprivation in adults can cause permanent damage.</p><p class='paraalign'><b>F.</b>&nbsp;Teenagers can have peculiar sleep requirements. It has always been known that adolescents spend more time sleeping than adults, but science has only recently isolated the reasons for this. Research now shows that growth hormones are secreted during slow-wave sleep and teenagers do indeed, need more of this kind of sleep than at any other stage in their lives. Chronic lack of sleep among teenagers means that as a group they are more likely to use stimulants and experience negative mood swings. Statistics also indicate that young drivers are responsible for more than one-half of fall- asleep crashes.</p><p class='paraalign'><b>G.</b>&nbsp;However, it is not just young people who pay the price for lack of proper sleep. Workers are robbing themselves of sleep in order to increase productivity in both their social and working lives. In recent years, however, the identification of driver fatigue as the possible cause of 1/3 of all accidents provides some indication of the price we are paying for such a trade-off. Extensive scientific research indicates that chronic tiredness has been the cause of environmental disasters, nuclear mishaps and several well-documented near misses in the air. Scientists are beginning to argue that the lengthening of the working day is harming workers, their families and society. In the long run, productivity will suffer.</p><p class='paraalign'><b>H.</b>&nbsp;As a reaction against this disturbing trend, there has been increased support for regulation of the number of hours worked by employees in demanding jobs, such as doctors, nurses, pilots, bus drivers and truck drivers. Legislation is being drafted to limit work hours, thus forcing companies to become instrumental in changing work cultures to ensure employees are getting enough rest and leisure time in order to avoid chronic tiredness and its devastating consequences.</p>",

      "paragraph": "<p class='paraalign'> <span><center><h3>SALINISATION</h3</center></span><p class='paraalign'>Salinisation (the accumulation of salts in soil) is one of today's worst environmental disasters and yet it does not share the global spotlight with other ecological issues. Considering the threat that salinisation poses to nearly all irrigated drylands and the consequential impact on traditional agriculture, such lagging public awareness is, at the very least, disconcerting. Reports indicate that between 2.5 and 6 million hectares of land are affected by salinisation and unless precautionary and remedial measures are implemented, economic and environmental repercussions will be inevitable.</p><p class='paraalign'>Contributing ecological factors such as soil-type, climate, rainfall and topography make some lands more vulnerable to the salinisation process. However, the vast majority of land degraded through salinisation can be directly linked to human activity, whether it be destroying natural vegetation and bushlands to clear the land for farms, over-irrigation of cultivated land and/or poor farming practices. Countries like Australia are beginning to see the devastation of increasing salinity levels after a relatively short period of introduced European farming methods.</p><p class='paraalign'>Salts such as sodium chloride and calcium sulphates, occur naturally in many soils and waterways. When the concentration of salt levels (salinity) in soil becomes too high, plant growth is adversely affected and the soil structure can be damaged.</p><p class='paraalign'>Nature dealt reasonably successfully with salinity levels in Australia prior to European settlement. Natural vegetation, including perennial grasses and deep-rooted trees, ensured that salts were dissolved as rainwater slowly filtered down through the soil. Salt was moved downward and remained in the groundwater below the root zone of the plants. The fibrous root structure of those native plants, acted as an effective filter with their high water-holding capacity. Some rainwater was held by the roots and some rainwater leached downwards through the soil carrying the dissolved salts. Groundwater transpired back into the air through the foliage of the native plants.</p><p class='paraalign'>As Europeans introduced traditional forms of agriculture and cleared large areas of land for grazing in the 1800s, much of the native vegetation in Australia was replaced by generally shallow-rooted annual crops and pastures, substantially changing the natural process that had been working well. These crops and pastures use less water than original native vegetation and the roots do not have the same water-holding capacity. With the introduction of these crops, more rainwater and irrigated water makes its way downwards through the soil to below the root-zone. The water still carries the dissolved salts downwards past the root-zone but the amount and level of groundwater is increased. In addition, because the roots of these crops do not hold as much water, the water is drawn back up from the groundwater later, as the plant needs moisture.</p><p class='paraalign'>We see then that the amount and level of groundwater increases because of an increase in the amount of water being put into the soil and not being held in fibrous root structures like that of native vegetation. This causes the water table to rise, bringing dissolved salts with it that eventually reach the surface of the soil. Water is then evaporated from the surface leaving high concentrations of salts behind. This is the process of salinisation.</p></p><p class='paraalign'>Soils with high salinity levels occur naturally in Australia but these were mostly confined to particular coastal and sub-coastal areas. Over the past 200 years, the total area affected by salinisation has expanded and has now spread to inland areas. Groundwater salts that have been accumulating over thousands of years are now rising to the surface. When this groundwater enters the root zone of the cultivated plants which are naturally not salt tolerant, the plants die. The effects are not limited to the particular cleared site where soil becomes unsuitable for plant production. Salty groundwater can travel along the natural contours of the land into other agricultural areas, creating salty discharge sites quite some distance from the recharge zone. Native aquatic and land-based habitats are now at risk, threatening the biological diversity in Australia. It is therefore necessary for groundwater and surface run-off water to be dealt with.</p></p><p class='paraalign'>Land managers or farmers do not have to wait until crops die to recognize that salinity levels are out of control. Declining yields in crop production, sick or dying trees around the property or the appearance of salt-tolerant species all serve as a warning that salinity levels have increased. If these signs are ignored and the lands become degraded, combating salinity will become expensive and time-consuming.</p></p><p class='paraalign'>One current practice is to replant trees in an effort to draw the water table down and slow the salinisation process but this alone will be inadequate. Investigations are also being made into planting salt-tolerant crops and pastures whilst building up and preserving native species and remnant bushland areas. More effective techniques to counteract the drainage problems in the form of drainage canals are also being canvassed. These hope to achieve a balance between the volume of water entering the soil in the recharge zone and the volume of water that leaves as discharge.</p></p><p class='paraalign'>The key to fighting salinity is through long-term management practices on agricultural land that recognize the importance of the role that native vegetation plays in keeping water balance in the soil. These practices will need to consider agricultural requirements along with land and water care i.e. balancing economic development with environmental protection. Moreover, a public awareness campaign with government-funded incentives must make it clear that current farming practices in at-Ask landscapes are not sustainable and cannot be tolerated.</p></p>",
