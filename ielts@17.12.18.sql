In the last ten years advertising for fast food outlets has rapidly increased. There is some evidence that the dominance of television has recently begun to wane. The importance of strong, global branding reinforces a need for multi-faceted communications combining television with merchandising, ‘tie-ins’ and point of sale activity. The advertised diet contrasts sharply with that recommended by public health advisors, and themes of fun and fantasy or taste, rather than health and nutrition, are used to promote it to children. Meanwhile, the recommended diet gets little promotional support.</p><p><strong><b>B</b></strong><span> </span>There is plenty of evidence that children notice and enjoy food promotion. However, establishing whether this actually influences them is a complex problem. The review tackled it by looking at studies that had examined possible effects on what children know about food, their food preferences, their actual food behaviour (both buying and eating), and their health outcomes (eg. obesity or cholesterol levels). The majority of studies examined food advertising, but a few examined other forms of food promotion. In terms of nutritional knowledge, food advertising seems to have little influence on children’s general perceptions of what constitutes a healthy diet, but, in certain contexts, it does have an effect on more specific types of nutritional knowledge. For example, seeing soft drink and cereal adverts reduced primary aged children’s ability to determine correctly whether or not certain products contained real fruit.</p><p><strong><b>C</b></strong><span> </span>The review also found evidence that food promotion influences children’s food preferences and their purchase behaviour. A study of primary school children, for instance, found that exposure to advertising influenced which foods they claimed to like; and another showed that labelling and signage on a vending machine had an effect on what was bought by secondary school pupils. A number of studies have also shown that food advertising can influence what children eat. One, for example, showed that advertising influenced a primary class’s choice of daily snack at playtime.</p><p><strong><b>D</b></strong><span> </span>The next step, of trying to establish whether or not a link exists between food promotion and diet or obesity, is extremely difficult as it requires research to be done in real world settings. A number of studies have attempted this by using amount of television viewing as a proxy for exposure to television advertising. They have established a clear link between television viewing and diet, obesity, and cholesterol levels. It is impossible to say, however, whether this effect is caused by the advertising, the sedentary nature of television viewing or snacking that might take place whilst viewing. One study resolved this problem by taking a detailed diary of children’s viewing habits. This showed that the more food adverts they saw, the more snacks and calories they consumed.</p><p><strong><b>E</b></strong><span> </span>Thus the literature does suggest food promotion is influencing children’s diet in a number of ways. This does not amount to proof; as noted above with this kind of research, incontrovertible proof simply isn’t attainable. Nor do all studies point to this conclusion; several have not found an effect. In addition, very few studies have attempted to measure how strong these effects are relative to other factors influencing children’s food choices. Nonetheless, many studies have found clear effects and they have used sophisticated methodologies that make it possible to determine that i) these effects are not just due to chance; ii) they are independent of other factors that may influence diet, such as parents’ eating habits or attitudes; and iii) they occur at a brand and category level.</p><p><strong><b>F</b></strong><span> </span>Furthermore, two factors suggest that these findings actually downplay the effect that food promotion has on children. First, the literature focuses principally on television advertising; the cumulative effect of this combined with other forms of promotion and marketing is likely to be significantly greater. Second, the studies have looked at direct effects on individual children, and understate indirect influences. For example, promotion for fast food outlets may not only influence the child, but also encourage parents to take them for meals and reinforce the idea that this is a normal and desirable behaviour.</p><p><strong><b>G</b></strong><span> </span>This does not amount to proof<span> </span>of an effect, but in our view does provide sufficient evidence to conclude that an effect exists. The debate should now shift to what action is needed, and specifically to how the power of commercial marketing can be used to bring about improvements in young people’s eating.</p></div><!--EndFragment-->', 0, 0, 'reading', '', '', '2018-10-11 06:58:27'),

The Earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago. It is one of four rocky planets on the inside of the Solar System. The other three are Mercury, Venus, and Mars.</p><p class="text-align-justify" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><b>B</b></strong> The large mass of the Sun makes the Earth move around it, just as the mass of the Earth makes the Moon move around it. The Earth also turns round in space, so different parts face the Sun at different times. The Earth goes around the Sun once (one &#34;year&#34;) for every 365¼ times it turns all the way around (one &#34;day&#34;).</p><p class="text-align-justify" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><b>C</b></strong> The Moon goes around the Earth about every 27⅓ days, and reflects light from the Sun. As the Earth goes round the Sun at the same time, the changing light of the Moon takes about 29½ days to go from dark to bright to dark again. That is where the idea of &#34;month&#34; came from. However, now most months have 30 or 31 days so they fit into one year.</p><p class="text-align-justify" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><b>D</b></strong> The Earth is the only planet in our Solar System that has a large amount of liquid water. About 71% of the surface of the Earth is covered by oceans. Because of this, it is sometimes called the &#34;Blue Planet&#34;.</p><p class="text-align-justify" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><b>E</b></strong> Because of its water, the Earth is home to millions of species of plants and animals. The things that live on Earth have changed its surface greatly. For example, early cyanobacteria changed the air and gave it oxygen. The living part of the Earth\'s surface is called the &#34;biosphere&#34;.</p><p class="text-align-justify" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><b>F</b></strong> The Earth is part of the eight planets and many thousands of small bodies that move around the Sun as its Solar System. The Solar System is moving through the Orion Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy now, and will be for about the next 10,000 years.</p><p class="text-align-justify" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><b>G</b></strong> The Earth is generally 150,000,000 kilometers or 93,000,000 miles away from the Sun (this distance is named an &#34;Astronomical Unit&#34;). The Earth moves along its way at an average speed of about 30 km or 19 mi a second. The Earth turns all the way around about 365¼ times in the time it takes for the Earth to go all the way around the Sun. To make up this extra bit of a day every year, an additional day is used every four years. This is named a &#34;leap year&#34;.</p><p class="text-align-justify" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><b>H</b></strong> The Moon goes around the Earth at an average distance of 400,000 kilometers (250,000 mi). It is locked to Earth, so that it always has the same half facing the Earth; the other half is called the &#34;dark side of the Moon&#34;. It takes about 27⅓ days for the Moon to go all the way around the Earth but, because the Earth is moving around the Sun at the same time, it takes about 29½ days for the Moon to go from dark to bright to dark again. This is where the word &#34;month&#34; came from, even though most months now have 30 or 31 days.</p></div><!--EndFragment-->', 0, 0, 'reading', '', '', '2018-10-11 07:04:20'),

But another &#34;market&#34; is just as important: your employees, the very people who can make the brand come alive for your customers. Yet in our work helping executives develop and carry out branding campaigns, my colleagues and I have found that companies very often ignore this critical constituency.</p><p>Why is internal marketing so important? First, because it\'s the best way to help employees make a powerful emotional connection to the products and services you sell. Without that connection, employees are likely to undermine the expectations set by your advertising. In some cases, this is because they simply don\'t understand what you have promised the public, so they end up working at cross-purposes. In other cases, it may be they don\'t actually believe in the brand and feel disengaged or, worse, hostile toward the company. We\'ve found that when people care about and believe in the brand, they\'re motivated to work harder and their loyalty to the company increases. Employees are united and inspired by a common sense of purpose and identity.</p><p>Unfortunately, in most companies, internal marketing is done poorly, if at all. While executives recognise the need to keep people informed about the company\'s strategy and direction, few understand the need to convince employees of the brand\'s power—they take it as a given.</p><p>Employees need to hear the same messages that you send out to the marketplace. At most companies, however, internal and external communications are often mismatched. This can be very confusing, and it threatens employees\' perceptions of the company\'s integrity: They are told one thing by management but observe that a different message is being sent to the public. One health insurance company, for instance, advertised that the welfare of patients was the company\'s number one priority, while employees were told that their main goal was to increase the value of their stock options through cost reductions. And one major financial services institution told customers that it was making a major shift in focus from being a financial retailer to a financial adviser, but, a year later, research showed that the customer experience with the company had not changed. It turned out that company leaders had not made an effort to sell the change internally, so employees were still churning out transactions and hadn\'t changed their behavior to match their new adviser role.</p><p>Enabling employees to deliver on customer expectations is important, of course, but it\'s not the only reason a company needs to match internal and external messages. Another reason is to help push the company to achieve goals that might otherwise be out of reach. In 1997, when IBM launched its e-business campaign (which is widely credited for turning around the company\'s image), it chose to ignore research that suggested consumers were unpre-pared to embrace IBM as a leader in e-business. Although to the outside world this looked like an external marketing effort, IBM was also using the campaign to align employees</p><p>around the idea of the Internet as the future of technology. The internal campaign changed the way employees thought about everything they did, from how they named products to how they organised staff to how they approached selling. The campaign was successful largely because it gave employees a sense of direction and purpose, which in turn restored their confidence in IBM\'s ability to predict the future and lead the technology industry. Today, research shows that people are four times more likely to associate the term &#34;e-busi-ness&#34; with IBM than with its nearest competitor.</p><p>Perhaps even more important, by taking employees into account, a company can avoid creating a message that doesn\'t resonate with staff or, worse, one that builds resentment. In 1996, United Airlines shelved its &#34;Come Fly the Friendly Skies&#34; slogan when presented with a survey that revealed the depth of customer resentment toward the airline industry. In an effort to own up to the industry\'s shortcomings, United launched a new campaign, &#34;Rising,&#34; in which it sought to differentiate itself by acknowledging poor service and prom-ising incremental improvements such as better meals. While this was a logical premise for the campaign given the tenor of the times, a campaign focusing on customers\' distaste for flying was deeply discouraging to the staff. Employee resentment, ultimately made it impos-sible for United to deliver the improvements it was promising, which in turn undermined the &#34;Rising&#34; pledge. Three years later, United decided employee opposition was under-mining its success and pulled the campaign. It has since moved to a more inclusive brand message with the line &#34;United,&#34; which both audiences can embrace. Here, a fundamental principle of advertising—find and address a customer concern—failed United because it did not consider the internal market.</p><p>When it comes to execution, the most common and effective way to link internal and external marketing campaigns is to create external advertising that targets both audiences. IBM used this tactic very effectively when it launched its e-business campaign, It took out an eight-page ad in the Wall Street Journal declaring its new vision, a message directed at both customers and internal stakeholders. This is an expensive way to capture attention, but if used sparingly, it is the most powerful form of communication; in fact, you need do it only once for everyone in the company to read it. There\'s a symbolic advantage as well. Such a tactic signals that the company is taking its pledge very seriously; it also signals transparency—the same message going out to both audiences.</p><p>Advertising isn’t the only way to link internal and external marketing. At Nike, a number of senior executives now hold the additional title of &#34;Corporate Storyteller.&#34; They deliberately avoid stories of financial successes and concentrate on parables of &#34;just doing it,&#34; reflecting and reinforcing the company\'s ad campaigns. One tale, for example, recalls how legendary coach and Nike cofounder Bill Bowerman, in an effort to build a better shoe for his team, poured rubber into the family waffle iron, giving birth to the prototype of Nike\'s famous Waffle Sole. By talking about such inventive moves, the company hopes to keep the spirit of innovation that characterises its ad campaigns alive and well within the company.</p><p>But while their messages must be aligned, companies must also keep external promises a little ahead of internal realities. Such promises provide incentives for employees and give them something to live up to. In the 1980s, Ford turned &#34;Quality Is Job 1&#34; from an internal rallying cry into a consumer slogan in response to the threat from cheaper, more reliable Japanese cars. It did so before the claim was fully justified, but by placing it in the public arena, it gave employees an incentive to match the Japanese. If the promise is pushed too far ahead, however, it loses credibility. When a beleaguered British Rail launched a cam-paign announcing service improvements under the banner &#34;We\'re Getting There,&#34; it did so prematurely. By drawing attention to the gap between the promise and the reality, it prompted destructive press coverage. This, in turn, demoralised staff, who had been legiti-mately proud of the service advances they had made.</p></div><!--EndFragment--><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>', 0, 0, 'reading', '', '', '2018-10-11 09:31:05'),

For hundreds of years in the Jiangyong County of Hunan Province, China, this was quite literally the case. Sometime between 400 and 1,000 years ago, women defied the patriarchal norms of the time that forbade them to read or write and conceived of Nu shu — literally, ‘ women’s language ’ — a secretive script and language of their own. Through building informal networks of ‘sworn sisters’ who committed themselves to teaching the language only to other women, and by using it artistically in ways that could be passed off as artwork (such as writing characters on a decorative fan), Nushu was able to grow and spread without attracting too much suspicion.</p><p class="text-align-justify" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><b>B.</b></strong> Nushu has many orthographical distinctions from the standard Chinese script. Whereas standard Chinese has large, bold strokes that look as if they might have been shaped with a thick permanent marker pen, Nushu characters are thin, slanted and have a slightly ‘scratchy’ appearance that bears more similarity to calligraphy. Whereas standard Chinese is logographic, with characters that represent words and meanings, Nushu is completely phonetic — each character represents a sound; the meaning must be acquired from the context of what is being said. Users of Nushu developed coded meanings for various words and phrases, but it is likely that only a tiny fraction of these will ever be known. Many secrets of Nushu have gone to the grave.</p><p class="text-align-justify" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><b>C.</b></strong> Nushu was developed as a way to allow women to communicate with one another in confidence. To some extent, this demand came from a desire for privacy, and Nushu allowed women a forum for personal written communication in a society that was dominated by a male-orientated social culture. There was also a practical element to the rise of Nushu, however: until the mid 20th century, women were rarely encouraged to become literate in the standard Chinese script. Nushu provided a practical and easy-to-learn alternative. Women who were separated from their families and friends by marriage could, therefore, send ‘letters’ to each other. Unlike traditional correspondence, however, Nushu characters were painted or embroidered onto everyday items like fans, pillowcases, and handkerchiefs and embodied in ‘artwork’ in order to avoid making men suspicious.</p><p class="text-align-justify" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><b>D.</b></strong> After the Chinese Revolution, more women were encouraged to become literate in the standard Chinese script, and much of the need for a special form of women’s communication was dampened. When the Red Guard discovered the script in the 1960s, they thought it to be a code used for espionage. Upon learning that it was a secret women’s language, they were suspicious and fearful. Numerous letters, weavings, embroideries, and other artefacts were destroyed, and women were forbidden to practise Nushu customs. As a consequence, the generational chains of linguistic transmission were broken up, and the language ceased being passed down through sworn sisters. There is no longer anyone alive who has learnt Nushu in this traditional manner; Yang Huanyi, the last proficient user of the language, died on September 20, 2004, in her late 90s.</p><p class="text-align-justify" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><b>E.</b></strong><span> </span>In recent years, however, popular and scholarly interest in Nushu has blossomed. The Ford Foundation granted US$209,000 to build a Nu shu Museum that houses artefacts such as audio recordings, manuscripts, and articles, some of which date back over 100 years. The investment from Hong Kong SAR is also being used to build infrastructure at potential tourist sites in Hunan, and some schools in the area have begun instruction in the language. Incidentally, the use of Nushu is also a theme in Lisa See’s historical novel. Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,which has since been adapted for film.</p></div><!--EndFragment--><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>', 0, 0, 'reading', '', '', '2018-10-12 05:34:28'),

For this reason, it is the site of a vault that will safeguard a priceless component of our common heritage – the seeds of our staple crops. Here, seeds from the world’s most vital food crops will be locked away for hundreds or even thousands of years. If something goes wrong in the world, the vault will provide the means to restore farming. We, or our descendants, will not have to retread thousands of years of agriculture from scratch.</span></div><div><br/></div><div>Deep in the vault at the end of a long tunnel, are three storage vaults which are lined with insulated panels to help maintain the cold temperatures. Electronic transmitters linked to a satellite system monitor temperature, etc. and pass the information back to the appropriate authorities at Longycarbyen and the Nordic Gene Bank which provide the technical information for managing the seed vaults. The seeds are placed in scaled boxes and stored on shelves in the vaults. The minimal moisture level and low temperature ensure low metabolic activity. The remote location, as well as the rugged structure, provide unparalleled security for the world’s agricultural heritage.</div><p><span style="color: inherit;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: inherit;">The three vaults are buried deep in the hillside. To reach them, it is necessary to proceed down a long and surprisingly large corridor. At 93.3 metres in length, it connects the 26-metre long entrance building to the three vaults, each of which extends a further 27 metres into the mountain. Towards the end of this tunnel, after about 80 metres, there are several small rooms on the right-hand side. One is a transformer room to which only the power company officials have access – this houses the equipment needed to transform the incoming electrical current down to 220 volts. A second is an electrical room housing controls for the compressor and other equipment. I he oilier room is an office which can be heated to provide comfortable working conditions for those who will make an inventory of the samples in and out of the vault.</span><br/></p><!--EndFragment--><p><span>Anyone seeking access to the seeds has to pass through four locked doors: the heavy steel entrance doors, a second door approximately 90 metres down the tunnel and finally the two keyed doors separated by an airlock, from which it is possible to proceed directly into the seed vaults. Keys are coded to allow access to different levels of the facility. A work of art will make the vault visible for miles with reflective sheets of steel and mirrors which form an installation acting as a beacon. It reflects polar light in the summer months, while in the winter, a network of 200 fibre-optic cables will give the piece a muted greenish-turquoise and white light. Cary Fowler, the mastermind behind the vault, stands inside the echoing cavern. For him, this is the culmination of nearly 30 years of work. ‘It’s an insurance policy,’ he explains, ‘a very cheap insurance policy when you consider what we’re insuring – the earth’s biological diversity.</span></p><p>Seeds are being brought here from all over the world, from seed banks created by governments, universities and private institutions. Soon, there will be seed varieties from at least 100 crops in the Svalbard vault – extending to examples of all of the 1.5 million known crop seed varieties in the world. If any more are unearthed. either in the wild or found in obscure collections, they can be added, too – the vault has room for at least 4.5 million samples. Inside the entrance area it is more than 10® C below freezing, but in the chambers where the seeds are kept, refrigerators push down the temperature even further, to -18oC. At this temperature, which will be kept constant to stop the seeds germinating or rotting, the wheat seeds will remain viable for an estimated 1.700 vears. the years.</p><!--EndFragment--><p><br/></p>', 0, 0, 'reading', '', '', '2018-10-25 05:39:06'),

Children are subject to up to 3.9 times more pollution in a car that is standing in traffic than when walking or cycling to school. Reducing cars around schools makes them safer places, and walking and cycling are better for health and the environment.

We collect data annually about how pupils get to school, and our report on the Sustainable School Travel Strategy sets out in detail what we have achieved so far and what we intend to do in the future. Different parts of the County Council are working together to address the actions identified in the strategy, and we are proud that we have been able to reduce the number of cars on the daily school run by an average of 1% in each of the last three years, which is equivalent to takingapproximately 175 cars off the road annually, despite an increase in pupil numbers.</p><p style="color: rgb(40, 40, 40);">All schools have a School Travel Plan, which sets out how the school and the Council can collaborate to help reduce travel to school by car and encourage the use of public transport.

Produce, hides and timber were brought to Morpeth from inland New South Wales and shipped down the Hunter river to the coast and then to Sydney.

In the last ten years advertising for fast food outlets has rapidly increased. There is some evidence that the dominance of television has recently begun to wane. The importance of strong, global branding reinforces a need for multi-faceted communications combining television with merchandising, ‘tie-ins’ and point of sale activity. The advertised diet contrasts sharply with that recommended by public health advisors, and themes of fun and fantasy or taste, rather than health and nutrition, are used to promote it to children. Meanwhile, the recommended diet gets little promotional support.</p><p><strong><b>B</b></strong><span> </span>There is plenty <span class="review_2 review"><span class="number2">Q2</span>of evidence that children notice and enjoy food promotion.</span> However, establishing whether <span class="review_9 review"><span class="number9">Q9</span>this actually influences them is a complex </span>problem. The review tackled it by looking at studies that had examined possible effects on what children know about food, their food preferences, their actual food behaviour (both buying and eating), and their health outcomes (eg. obesity or cholesterol levels). The majority of studies examined food advertising, but a few examined other forms of food promotion. In terms of nutritional knowledge, food advertising seems to have little influence on children’s general perceptions of what constitutes a healthy diet, but, in certain contexts, it does have an effect on more specific types of nutritional knowledge. For example, seeing soft drink and cereal adverts reduced primary aged children’s ability to determine correctly whether or not certain products contained real fruit.</p><p><strong><b>C</b></strong><span> </span>The review also found <span class="review_3 review"><span class="number3">Q3</span>evidence that food promotion influences </span>children’s food preferences<span class="review_10 review"><span class="number10">Q10</span> and their purchase behaviour. A study of </span>primary school children, for instance, found that exposure to advertising influenced which foods they claimed to like; and another showed that labelling and signage on a vending machine had an effect on what was bought by secondary school pupils. A number of studies have also shown that food advertising can influence what children eat. One, for example, showed that advertising influenced a primary class’s choice of daily snack at playtime.</p><p><strong><b>D</b></strong><span> </span>The next step, of trying to <span class="review_4 review"><span class="number4">Q4</span>establish whether or not a link </span>exists between food promotion and diet or <span class="review_11 review"><span class="number11">Q11</span>obesity, is extremely difficult as it requires </span>research to be done in real world settings. A number of studies have attempted this by using amount of television viewing as a proxy for exposure to television advertising. They have established a clear link between television viewing and diet, obesity, and cholesterol levels. It is impossible to say, however, whether this effect is caused by the advertising, the sedentary nature of television viewing or snacking that might take place whilst viewing. One study resolved this problem by taking a detailed diary of children’s viewing habits. This showed that the more food adverts they saw, the more snacks and calories they consumed.</p><p><strong><b>E</b></strong><span> </span>Thus the literature does suggest food promotion is <span class="review_5 review"><span class="number5">Q5</span>influencing children’s diet in a number of ways. </span>This does not amount to proof; as<span class="review_12 review"><span class="number12">Q12</span> noted above with this kind of research, </span>incontrovertible proof simply isn’t attainable. <span class="review_13 review"><span class="number13">Q13</span>Nor do all studies point to this</span> conclusion; several have not found an effect. In addition, very few studies have attempted to measure how strong these effects are relative to other factors influencing children’s food choices. Nonetheless, many studies have found clear effects and they have used sophisticated methodologies that make it possible to determine that i) these effects are not just due to chance; ii) they are independent of other factors that may influence diet, such as parents’ eating habits or attitudes; and iii) they occur at a brand and category level.</p><p><strong><b>F</b></strong><span> </span>Furthermore, two factors suggest that these findings actually downplay the effect that food <span class="review_6 review"><span class="number6">Q6</span>promotion has on children.</span> First, the literature focuses principally on television advertising; the cumulative effect of this combined with other forms of promotion and marketing is likely to be significantly greater. Second, the studies have looked at direct effects on individual children, and understate indirect influences. For example, promotion for fast food outlets may not only influence the child, but also encourage parents to take them for meals and reinforce the idea that this is a normal and desirable behaviour.</p><p><strong><b>G</b></strong><span> </span>This does not amount to proof<span> </span>of an effect,<span class="review_7 review"><span class="number7">Q7</span> but in our view does provide </span>sufficient evidence to conclude that an effect exists. The debate should now shift to what action is needed, and specifically to how the power  commercial marketing can be used to bring about improvements in young people’s eating.</p></div><!--EndFragment-->', '', '', '2018-10-11 07:28:54'),

In the last ten years advertising for fast food outlets has rapidly increased. There is some evidence that the dominance of television has recently begun to wane. The importance of strong, global branding reinforces a need for multi-faceted communications combining television with merchandising, ‘tie-ins’ and point of sale activity. The advertised diet contrasts sharply with that recommended by public health advisors, and themes of fun and fantasy or taste, rather than health and nutrition, are used to promote it to children. Meanwhile, the recommended diet gets little promotional support.</p><p><strong><b>B</b></strong><span> </span>There is plenty of evidence that children notice and enjoy food promotion. However, establishing whether this actually influences them is a complex problem. The review tackled it by looking at studies that had examined possible effects on what children know about food, their food preferences, their actual food behaviour (both buying and eating), and their health outcomes (eg. obesity or cholesterol levels). The majority of studies examined food advertising, but a few examined other forms of food promotion. In terms of nutritional knowledge, food advertising seems to have little influence on children’s general perceptions of what constitutes a healthy diet, but, in certain contexts, it does have an effect on more specific types of nutritional knowledge. For example, seeing soft drink and cereal adverts reduced primary aged children’s ability to determine correctly whether or not certain products contained real fruit.</p><p><strong><b>C</b></strong><span> </span>The review also found evidence that food promotion influences children’s food preferences and their purchase behaviour. A study of primary school children, for instance, found that exposure to advertising influenced which foods they claimed to like; and another showed that labelling and signage on a vending machine had an effect on what was bought by secondary school pupils. A number of studies have also shown that food advertising can influence what children eat. One, for example, showed that advertising influenced a primary class’s choice of daily snack at playtime.</p><p><strong><b>D</b></strong><span> </span>The next step, of trying to establish whether or not a link exists between food promotion and diet or obesity, is extremely difficult as it requires research to be done in real world settings. A number of studies have attempted this by using amount of television viewing as a proxy for exposure to television advertising. They have established a clear link between television viewing and diet, obesity, and cholesterol levels. It is impossible to say, however, whether this effect is caused by the advertising, the sedentary nature of television viewing or snacking that might take place whilst viewing. One study resolved this problem by taking a detailed diary of children’s viewing habits. This showed that the more food adverts they saw, the more snacks and calories they consumed.</p><p><strong><b>E</b></strong><span> </span>Thus the literature does suggest food promotion is influencing children’s diet in a number of ways. This does not amount to proof; as noted above with this kind of research, incontrovertible proof simply isn’t attainable. Nor do all studies point to this conclusion; several have not found an effect. In addition, very few studies have attempted to measure how strong these effects are relative to other factors influencing children’s food choices. Nonetheless, many studies have found clear effects and they have used sophisticated methodologies that make it possible to determine that i) these effects are not just due to chance; ii) they are independent of other factors that may influence diet, such as parents’ eating habits or attitudes; and iii) they occur at a brand and category level.</p><p><strong><b>F</b></strong><span> </span>Furthermore, two factors suggest that these findings actually downplay the effect that food promotion has on children. First, the literature focuses principally on television advertising; the cumulative effect of this combined with other forms of promotion and marketing is likely to be significantly greater. Second, the studies have looked at direct effects on individual children, and understate indirect influences. For example, promotion for fast food outlets may not only influence the child, but also encourage parents to take them for meals and reinforce the idea that this is a normal and desirable behaviour.</p><p><strong><b>G</b></strong><span> </span>This does not amount to proof<span> </span>of an effect, but in our view does provide sufficient evidence to conclude that an effect exists. The debate should now shift to what action is needed, and specifically to how the power of commercial marketing can be used to bring about improvements in young people’s eating.</p></div><!--EndFragment-->', '', '', '2018-10-11 07:47:02'),

But another &#34;market&#34; is just as important: your employees, the very people who can make the brand come alive for your customers. Yet in our work helping executives develop and carry out branding campaigns, my colleagues and I have found that companies very often ignore this critical constituency.</p><p>Why is internal marketing so important? First, because it\'s the best way to help employees make a powerful emotional connection to the products and services you sell. Without that connection, employees are likely to undermine the expectations set by your advertising. In some cases, this is because they simply don\'t understand what you have promised the public, so they end up working at cross-purposes. In other cases, it may be they don\'t actually believe in the brand and feel disengaged or, worse, hostile toward the company. We\'ve found that when people care about and believe in the brand, they\'re motivated to work harder and their loyalty to the company increases. Employees are united and inspired by a common sense of purpose and identity.</p><p>Unfortunately, in most companies, internal marketing is done poorly, if at all. While executives recognise the need to keep people informed about the company\'s strategy and direction, few understand the need to convince employees of the brand\'s power—they take it as a given.</p><p>Employees need to hear the same messages that you send out to the marketplace. At most companies, however, internal and external communications are often mismatched. This can be very confusing, and it threatens employees\' perceptions of the company\'s integrity: They are told one thing by management but observe that a different message is being sent to the public. One health insurance company, for instance, advertised that the welfare of patients was the company\'s number one priority, while employees were told that their main goal was to increase the value of their stock options through cost reductions. And one major financial services institution told customers that it was making a major shift in focus from being a financial retailer to a financial adviser, but, a year later, research showed that the customer experience with the company had not changed. It turned out that company leaders had not made an effort to sell the change internally, so employees were still churning out transactions and hadn\'t changed their behavior to match their new adviser role.</p><p>Enabling employees to deliver on customer expectations is important, of course, but it\'s not the only reason a company needs to match internal and external messages. Another reason is to help push the company to achieve goals that might otherwise be out of reach. In 1997, when IBM launched its e-business campaign (which is widely credited for turning around the company\'s image), it chose to ignore research that suggested consumers were unpre-pared to embrace IBM as a leader in e-business. Although to the outside world this looked like an external marketing effort, IBM was also using the campaign to align employees</p><p>around the idea of the Internet as the future of technology. The internal campaign changed the way employees thought about everything they did, from how they named products to how they organised staff to how they approached selling. The campaign was successful largely because it gave employees a sense of direction and purpose, which in turn restored their confidence in IBM\'s ability to predict the future and lead the technology industry. Today, research shows that people are four times more likely to associate the term &#34;e-busi-ness&#34; with IBM than with its nearest competitor.</p><p>Perhaps even more important, by taking employees into account, a company can avoid creating a message that doesn\'t resonate with staff or, worse, one that builds resentment. In 1996, United Airlines shelved its &#34;Come Fly the Friendly Skies&#34; slogan when presented with a survey that revealed the depth of customer resentment toward the airline industry. In an effort to own up to the industry\'s shortcomings, United launched a new campaign, &#34;Rising,&#34; in which it sought to differentiate itself by acknowledging poor service and prom-ising incremental improvements such as better meals. While this was a logical premise for the campaign given the tenor of the times, a campaign focusing on customers\' distaste for flying was deeply discouraging to the staff. Employee resentment, ultimately made it impos-sible for United to deliver the improvements it was promising, which in turn undermined the &#34;Rising&#34; pledge. Three years later, United decided employee opposition was under-mining its success and pulled the campaign. It has since moved to a more inclusive brand message with the line &#34;United,&#34; which both audiences can embrace. Here, a fundamental principle of advertising—find and address a customer concern—failed United because it did not consider the internal market.</p><p>When it comes to execution, the most common and effective way to link internal and external marketing campaigns is to create external advertising that targets both audiences. IBM used this tactic very effectively when it launched its e-business campaign, It took out an eight-page ad in the Wall Street Journal declaring its new vision, a message directed at both customers and internal stakeholders. This is an expensive way to capture attention, but if used sparingly, it is the most powerful form of communication; in fact, you need do it only once for everyone in the company to read it. There\'s a symbolic advantage as well. Such a tactic signals that the company is taking its pledge very seriously; it also signals transparency—the same message going out to both audiences.</p><p>Advertising isn’t the only way to link internal and external marketing. At Nike, a number of senior executives now hold the additional title of &#34;Corporate Storyteller.&#34; They deliberately avoid stories of financial successes and concentrate on parables of &#34;just doing it,&#34; reflecting and reinforcing the company\'s ad campaigns. One tale, for example, recalls how legendary coach and Nike cofounder Bill Bowerman, in an effort to build a better shoe for his team, poured rubber into the family waffle iron, giving birth to the prototype of Nike\'s famous Waffle Sole. By talking about such inventive moves, the company hopes to keep the spirit of innovation that characterises its ad campaigns alive and well within the company.</p><p>But while their messages must be aligned, companies must also keep external promises a little ahead of internal realities. Such promises provide incentives for employees and give them something to live up to. In the 1980s, Ford turned &#34;Quality Is Job 1&#34; from an internal rallying cry into a consumer slogan in response to the threat from cheaper, more reliable Japanese cars. It did so before the claim was fully justified, but by placing it in the public arena, it gave employees an incentive to match the Japanese. If the promise is pushed too far ahead, however, it loses credibility. When a beleaguered British Rail launched a cam-paign announcing service improvements under the banner &#34;We\'re Getting There,&#34; it did so prematurely. By drawing attention to the gap between the promise and the reality, it prompted destructive press coverage. This, in turn, demoralised staff, who had been legiti-mately proud of the service advances they had made.</p></div><!--EndFragment--><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>', '', '', '2018-10-11 09:51:39'),

By drawing attention to the gap between the promise and the reality, it prompted destructive press coverage. This, in turn, demoralised staff, who had been legiti-mately proud of the service advances they had made.</p></div><!--EndFragment--><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>', '', '', '2018-10-11 10:21:17'),

Sometime between 400 and&nbsp;1,000&nbsp;years ago, women defied the patriarchal norms of the time that forbade them to read or write and conceived of&nbsp;Nu shu —&nbsp;literally, ‘&nbsp;women’s&nbsp;language ’ — a secretive script and language of their own. Through building informal networks of ‘sworn sisters’ who committed themselves to teaching the language only to other women, and by using it artistically in ways that could be passed off as artwork (such as writing characters on a decorative fan),&nbsp;Nushu&nbsp;was able to grow and spread without attracting too much suspicion.</p><p class="text-align-justify" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><b>B.</b></strong>&nbsp;Nushu&nbsp;has many orthographical distinctions from the standard <span class="review_2 review"><span class="number2">Q2</span>Chinese script. Whereas standard Chinese </span>has large, bold strokes that<span class="review_7 review"><span class="number7">Q7</span> look as if they might have been shaped</span> with a thick permanent marker pen,&nbsp;Nushu&nbsp;characters are thin, slanted and have a slightly ‘scratchy’ appearance that bears more similarity to calligraphy. Whereas standard Chinese is logographic, with characters that represent words and meanings,&nbsp;Nushu&nbsp;is completely phonetic — each character represents a sound; the meaning must be acquired from the context of what is being said. Users of&nbsp;Nushu&nbsp;developed coded meanings for various words and phrases, but it is likely that only a tiny fraction of these will ever be known. Many secrets of&nbsp;Nushu&nbsp;have gone to the grave.</p><p class="text-align-justify" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><b>C.</b></strong>&nbsp;Nushu&nbsp;was developed as <span class="review_3 review"><span class="number3">Q3</span>a way to allow women to communicate with one another </span>in confidence. To some extent, <span class="review_8 review"><span class="number8">Q8</span>this demand came from a desire for </span>privacy, and&nbsp;Nushu&nbsp;allowed women a forum for personal written communication in a society that was dominated by a male-orientated social culture. There was also a practical element to the rise of&nbsp;Nushu,&nbsp;however: until the mid&nbsp;20th&nbsp;century, women were rarely encouraged to become literate in the standard Chinese script.&nbsp;Nushu&nbsp;provided a practical and easy-to-learn alternative. Women who were separated from their families and friends by marriage could, therefore, send ‘letters’ to each other. Unlike traditional correspondence, however,&nbsp;Nushu&nbsp;characters were painted or embroidered onto everyday items like fans, pillowcases, and handkerchiefs and embodied in ‘artwork’ in order to avoid making men suspicious.</p><p class="text-align-justify" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><b>D.</b></strong>&nbsp;After the Chinese Revolution, more women <span class="review_4 review"><span class="number4">Q4</span>were encouraged to become literate in</span> the standard Chinese <span class="review_9 review"><span class="number9">Q9</span>script, and much of the need for</span> a special form of&nbsp;women’s&nbsp;communication was dampened. When the Red Guard discovered the script in the&nbsp;1960s,&nbsp;they thought it to be a code used for espionage. Upon learning that it was a secret&nbsp;women’s&nbsp;language, they were suspicious and fearful. Numerous letters, weavings, embroideries, and other artefacts were destroyed, and women were forbidden to practise&nbsp;Nushu&nbsp;customs. As a consequence, the generational chains of linguistic transmission were broken up, and the language ceased being passed down through sworn sisters. There is no longer anyone alive who has learnt&nbsp;Nushu&nbsp;in this traditional manner; Yang Huanyi, the last proficient user of the language, died on September 20,&nbsp;2004,&nbsp;in her late&nbsp;90s.</p><p class="text-align-justify" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><b>E.</b></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>In recent years, however, popular and scholarly interest in&nbsp;Nushu&nbsp;has blossomed. The Ford Foundation granted&nbsp;US$209,000&nbsp;to build a&nbsp;Nu shu&nbsp;Museum <span class="review_5 review"><span class="number5">Q5</span>that houses artefacts such as audio</span> recordings, manuscripts, <span class="review_10 review"><span class="number10">Q10</span>and articles, some of which date back over 100 years</span>. The investment from Hong Kong SAR is also being used to build infrastructure at potential tourist sites in Hunan, and some <span class="review_11 review"><span class="number11">Q11</span>schools in the area have begun instruction in the language</span>.

For hundreds of years in the Jiangyong County of Hunan Province, China, this was quite literally the case. Sometime between 400 and 1,000 years ago, women defied the patriarchal norms of the time that forbade them to read or write and conceived of Nu shu — literally, ‘ women’s language ’ — a secretive script and language of their own. Through building informal networks of ‘sworn sisters’ who committed themselves to teaching the language only to other women, and by using it artistically in ways that could be passed off as artwork (such as writing characters on a decorative fan), Nushu was able to grow and spread without attracting too much suspicion.</p><p class="text-align-justify" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><b>B.</b></strong> Nushu has many orthographical distinctions from the standard Chinese script. Whereas standard Chinese has large, bold strokes that look as if they might have been shaped with a thick permanent marker pen, Nushu characters are thin, slanted and have a slightly ‘scratchy’ appearance that bears more similarity to calligraphy. Whereas standard Chinese is logographic, with characters that represent words and meanings, Nushu is completely phonetic — each character represents a sound; the meaning must be acquired from the context of what is being said. Users of Nushu developed coded meanings for various words and phrases, but it is likely that only a tiny fraction of these will ever be known. Many secrets of Nushu have gone to the grave.</p><p class="text-align-justify" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><b>C.</b></strong> Nushu was developed as a way to allow women to communicate with one another in confidence. To some extent, this demand came from a desire for privacy, and Nushu allowed women a forum for personal written communication in a society that was dominated by a male-orientated social culture. There was also a practical element to the rise of Nushu, however: until the mid 20th century, women were rarely encouraged to become literate in the standard Chinese script. Nushu provided a practical and easy-to-learn alternative. Women who were separated from their families and friends by marriage could, therefore, send ‘letters’ to each other. Unlike traditional correspondence, however, Nushu characters were painted or embroidered onto everyday items like fans, pillowcases, and handkerchiefs and embodied in ‘artwork’ in order to avoid making men suspicious.</p><p class="text-align-justify" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><b>D.</b></strong> After the Chinese Revolution, more women were encouraged to become literate in the standard Chinese script, and much of the need for a special form of women’s communication was dampened. When the Red Guard discovered the script in the 1960s, they thought it to be a code used for espionage. Upon learning that it was a secret women’s language, they were suspicious and fearful. Numerous letters, weavings, embroideries, and other artefacts were destroyed, and women were forbidden to practise Nushu customs. As a consequence, the generational chains of linguistic transmission were broken up, and the language ceased being passed down through sworn sisters. There is no longer anyone alive who has learnt Nushu in this traditional manner; Yang Huanyi, the last proficient user of the language, died on September 20, 2004, in her late 90s.</p><p class="text-align-justify" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><b>E.</b></strong><span> </span>In recent years, however, popular and scholarly interest in Nushu has blossomed. The Ford Foundation granted US$209,000 to build a Nu shu Museum that houses artefacts such as audio recordings, manuscripts, and articles, some of which date back over 100 years. The investment from Hong Kong SAR is also being used to build infrastructure at potential tourist sites in Hunan, and some schools in the area have begun instruction in the language. Incidentally, the use of Nushu is also a theme in Lisa See’s historical novel. Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,which has since been adapted for film.</p></div><!--EndFragment--><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>', '', '', '2018-10-12 06:17:31'),

During the 1830s and 1840s Morpeth became a major river port, due to its favourable location. Produce, hides and timber were brought to Morpeth from inland New South Wales and shipped down the Hunter river to the coast and then to Sydney. However, in 1870 a railway line reached the town, and the importance of river shipping began to decline.

(Another way to find this without a formula is to sketch the pentagon and choose one vertex. &nbsp;From this vertex draw as many diagonals as you can inside the pentagon. It will divide the pentagon into 3 triangles. The sum of angles in those 3 triangles is 540 degrees, which is the sum of all 5 angles of the pentagon. &nbsp;Now divide by 5 to get the measure of any one angle of the pentagon and you get 108 degrees).</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;background-color: transparent;">Now let\'s find the number of distinct diagonals in the pentagon.

All Middle English long vowels underwent extensive alteration in passing into Modern English, but the short vowels, in accented syllables, remained comparatively stable.  If we compare Chaucer\'s pronunciation of the short vowels with ours, we note only two changes of importance, those of a and u.  By Shakespeare\'s day (i.e. at the close of the sixteenth century) Chaucer\'s a had become an [æ] in pronunciation (cat, thank, flax).  In some cases this Middle English a represented an Old English æ (at, apple, back) and the new pronunciation was therefore a return to approximately the form which the word had in Old English.  It is the usual pronunciation in America and a considerable part of southern England today.  The change which the u underwent was what is known as unrounding.

(1399, 0, 460187, 'verbal', '<p>For the classical scholar, the Germania by Tacitus is a minor work. However, for the student of the Germanic people, Tacitus’s ethnographic treatise is a major source of information, mainly reliable, about the German tribes of the first century A.D. Studies of Tacitus have often attempted to clarify the author’s purpose by defining it as an example of a particular literary genre. A few have seen the book primarily as a satire of Roman corruption, which uses the warlike but upright Germans as a stick with which to beat the degeneracy Tacitus observed in his contemporary Rome. Others classify the book as an extended political pamphlet whose central purpose is to urge Emperor Trajan to take some decisive Roman action to destroy the growing threat posed by the German tribes. Both of these themes are present in the Germania, but not central to its purpose; if they were, Tacitus would certainly have made them more prominent and explicit. The book’s purpose is obvious — to fully explain to a Roman audience what was known of the character of a neighboring people. In this task, Tacitus was following the examples of several earlier ethnographers, including Livy, whose books included an ethnographic study of the German people, and Seneca, who wrote works about the peoples of India and Egypt that resembled the Germania.

Add all of these together and the total cost of the five hamburgers is (5x – 10).We are told that the cost of just the first two hamburgers  (which we denote as [x + (x – 1)] is equal to 50% or (0.5) of the total cost of all five hamburgers.

Now move all variables to the right hand side and all numbers to the left hand side and we get  4 = 0.5x .

A zero unemployment rate would mean that no one ever entered or re-entered the labor force, that no one ever left a job and that the process of searching for a job consumed no time. Moreover, full  employment cannot be defined as an equality between the number of unemployed persons and the number of unfilled jobs. By this definition, almost any unemployment rate could be consistent with the full employment rate.In the U.S., the customary definition of the full employment rate is the lowest rate of unemployment that can be attained without resulting in an accelerated rate of inflation, given the existing economic conditions. However, based on this definition, no one can be sure exactly what the full employment rate is since it is impossible to predict exactly how much change in the rate of inflation will be associated with any given change in the unemployment rate. In the early 1960s, President Kennedy\'s Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) determined that 4 percent was the best estimate of the full employment rate. That rate was based on data collected during the period from mid-1955 to mid-1957, when the unemployment rate fluctuated around an average of 4.1 percent and the consumer price index advanced at an average rate of 2.5 percent per year. Although a 4 percent unemployment rate may have been consistent with an acceptably low rate of inflation in the mid-1950s, by the 1960s this proposition had become increasingly questionable. Our experience since then has been such that those who accept the customary definition of the full employment rate now consider 4.5 percent to be the optimal rate under the existing circumstances. The principal reason for this upward adjustment in the full employment rate is the changed composition of the labor force. As elderly people and women have joined the workforce in increasing numbers, the number of workers has increased. Similarly, the number of unemployed workers who are now eligible to collect benefits has increased. To the extent that these changes have increased voluntary and involuntary layoff rates and the average length of time unemployed persons spend looking for work, the full employment rate has risen.</p>', '<p>The passage suggests that which of the following best expresses the customary measure of full employment?</p>', 4, 'Test3-Sec1-VQ17', '<p>The correct answer is (C).

By this definition, almost any unemployment rate could be consistent with the full employment rate.In the U.S., the customary definition of the full employment rate is the lowest rate of unemployment that can be attained without resulting in an accelerated rate of inflation, given the existing economic conditions. However, based on this definition, no one can be sure exactly what the full employment rate is since it is impossible to predict exactly how much change in the rate of inflation will be associated with any given change in the unemployment rate. In the early 1960s, President Kennedy\'s Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) determined that 4 percent was the best estimate of the full employment rate. That rate was based on data collected during the period from mid-1955 to mid-1957, when the unemployment rate fluctuated around an average of 4.1 percent and the consumer price index advanced at an average rate of 2.5 percent per year. Although a 4 percent unemployment rate may have been consistent with an acceptably low rate of inflation in the mid-1950s, by the 1960s this proposition had become increasingly questionable. Our experience since then has been such that those who accept the customary definition of the full employment rate now consider 4.5 percent to be the optimal rate under the existing circumstances. The principal reason for this upward adjustment in the full employment rate is the changed composition of the labor force. As elderly people and women have joined the workforce in increasing numbers, the number of workers has increased. Similarly, the number of unemployed workers who are now eligible to collect benefits has increased.

The routine operations of acquiring oil have a damaging impact on the environment. In drilling an offshore well, operators customarily discard overboard their drill cuttings with some un-separated drilling mud (which is not actually mud but a combination of clay and chemicals). A typical 15,000-foot well usually produces more than 1,000 tons of drill cuttings. In addition, mineral salts, which may have distinctly harmful effects on some forms of marine life, are released from geological formations and are discharged after treatment in the course of production. Localized short-term impacts have been detected as a result. Routine discharges like these, along with chronic low-level oil leaks, present “considerable environmental risk,” the Council on Environmental Quality concluded in its report on OCS oil and gas. Digging channels for oil service ships and barges, building docks at the waterfront and laying pipeline cause another kind of environmental disruption. Instead of poisoning marine creatures, these activities tend to bury them, choke them or cut off light, which is essential to their whole food chain. Most importantly, dredging and filling change drainage patterns of wetlands and can lead to erosion or saltwater intrusion. Increased salinity of the water in marshes and estuaries is usually damaging to the adolescent fish, shellfish and other organisms residing there. They may not be able to tolerate the higher salinity or they may be decimated by invading predators with an affinity for saltier waters.Dredging for oil development was responsible for about one quarter of the loss of 500 square miles of Louisiana marsh in 30 years through 1972, according to studies done at Louisiana State University. Seen from the air, the changes in Louisiana’s wetlands from oil activity are striking. For miles in the vast coastal lowlands, the curving marshes are penetrated by geometrically straight channels—narrow ones for pipelines, broader ones for drill barges and rigs. Spoil from the dredging is piled in ridges on the channel banks, altering the natural drainage from dozens of streams. Altogether, the study concluded, dredging, filling and channelization in the Gulf of Mexico may have caused more damage than pollution from oil refining.</p>', '<p>It can be inferred from the passage that the normal salt levels of estuary waters </p>', 4, 'Test2-Sec2-VQ19', '<p>The correct answer is (A).

This question asks you to find the statement that most seriously undermines the reasoning in the argument.  The argument consists of a state representative\'s response to criticism regarding the inadequacy of their prison facilities. The representative attempts to counter this charge by saying that the state will allocate a lot of money to the prison in the coming year.  A statement that undermines this reasoning will suggest a way in which this relatively high spending level does not equate to adequate facilities.  Choice (A) presents unrelated information; we are concerned with the prison system in this state, not those in neighboring states.  Choice (B) suggests a reason why the prison facilities may be inadequate: if there has been a recent increase in felony convictions, then there may be more inmates than the system can handle.  This appears to undermine the representative\'s argument insofar that it shows that the critics were likely justified in calling the facilities inadequate.  However, we don\'t know how the increase in felony convictions actually affected the total number of inmates in the system; without this additional information, the statement in choice (B) can have no effect on the argument.  Choice (C) shows a way in which a high spending level may not signify adequate facilities. If the state allocates more money to the prison system than to other projects next year, then it must be true that the state\'s prison facilities have remained inadequate despite the efforts of the past few years. The discussion of funding should set off alarm bells because good funding does not equate with good results. Choice (D) is irrelevant; the prisons’ rehabilitation efforts are not in question.  Choice (E) has no effect on the argument; even if we agree that the state should not use their money in this way, a statement of opinion can have no bearing on an argument\'s logical structure.  Choice (C) most seriously undermines the representative\'s argument, and is the best choice.</p>', 1001),

While both groups initially considered themselves British subjects first, and only secondarily as residents of their particular geographic region, local identities had clearly gained primacy during the 18th century. While many factors contributed to this emerging identity, certain economic and cultural factors are perhaps the easiest on which to elaborate. Throughout the colonial period, New England maintained a remarkably homogeneous population. Its economy was broad based, consisting mainly of fishing, shipbuilding, manufacturing and farming. Most farming was for subsistence, not profit. On the other hand, the Southern colonies relied mainly on the farming of wealthy large estates known as plantations. These plantations were worked principally by slaves brought from Africa. In the late 18th century, these slaves nearly equaled the number of white colonists in Virginia. In South Carolina, they outnumbered the whites by nearly two-to-one. Not only did the plantations create a class system unknown in New England, but they also changed the nature of local government. In New England, people associated in compact villages, while in the South, plantations spread over so wide an area as to make villages impossible. In New England, the town was the natural unit of government; in the South, the county was all-important.

This answer does the least to weaken the argument.  Since the argument concludes that the Belmont students’ rate of professional success must be due to the quality of instruction offered at the school, we can eliminate any answer choice that suggests there might be another explanation for their success.  Note that it is not necessary to prove that another factor is responsible for the success rate, merely that another factor could be responsible.Choices (A), (D) and (E) provide alternative explanations for the students’ professional success.  If the school is competitive to begin with (A), then it is likely that only the best students will be admitted to this school.  If it is also true that students who are talented to begin with are more likely to achieve success, then this could explain why students who graduate from this school are more successful.  Similarly, if the students all have an usually high musical aptitude (D), or have been required to take business courses (E), then it could be more likely that they will succeed professionally.  Choice (B) weakens the argument by directly contradicting the conclusion.  If pianists trained at The Belmont School achieve greater success than those trained at any other school, and if their greater success is due to the quality of instruction offered at the school, then the school must offer some of the best instruction in the country.  Choice (B) tells us that this is not the case; instead, it is the school’s generous spending that is among the best in the country.  Unlike the other choices, choice (C) has no effect on the argument.  The fact that only two pianists trained at The Belmont School have achieved international success tells us nothing about the success of all Belmont School pianists relative to those who graduated from other schools.

The ultimate goals of the field are to enable the discovery of new biological insights and to create a global perspective from which unifying principles in biology can be discerned. At the beginning of the “genomic revolution,” a bioinformatics concern was the creation and maintenance of a database to store biological information, such as nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Development of this type of database involved not only design issues, but also the development of complex interfaces whereby researchers could both access existing data and submit new or revised data.Ultimately, all of this information must form a comprehensive picture of normal cellular activities so that researchers may study how these activities are altered in different disease states. Therefore, the field of bioinformatics has evolved such that the most pressing task now involves the analysis of various types of data, including nucleotide and amino acid sequences, protein domains, and protein structures. The actual process of analyzing and interpreting data is referred to as computational biology. Important sub-disciplines within bioinformatics and computational biology include the development and implementation of tools that enable efficient access to, and use and management of, various types of information; and the development of new algorithms (mathematical formulas) and statistics with which to assess relationships among members of large data sets, such as methods to locate a gene within a sequence, predict protein structure and/or function, and cluster protein sequences into families of related sequences.Bioinformatics promises to lead to advances in understanding basic biological processes and, in turn, advances in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of many genetic diseases.

The first thing we must do is to create an expression relating r to n.

There should be no difficulty in converting 20% = 20/100 = 1/5 and 50% = 1/2. So then our expression for r must be r = (1/5)(1/2) n = (1/10) n.

Once you assume that, the question becomes easy. We are told that the angle BAC = 60°. That leaves 120° to be split between the angles ABC and ACB. Because we know that DC and DB are angle bisectors (an angle bisector can be described as a line segment that divides an angle into two equal parts), AND we are told that the angle DCB is 40°, we can then find the value for the angle ACB by multiplying DCB by 2: 40 × 2 = 80°. Now we have the values for two of the angles in the triangle ABC: 60° + 80° = 140°, leaving 40° for the angle ABC.
